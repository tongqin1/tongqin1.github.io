I am currently a Senior Applied Scientist at Lab 126, Amazon, where I'm wokring on machine learning and computing on edge devices. Before joining Amazon, I spent several years in academia [teaching](./teaching.md) mathematics and doing [research](./publications.md) on scientific computing and scientific machine learning. I got my PhD in Applied Mathematics from Brown University.

In my spare time, I like reading math and history, coding and spending time with my daughter and son.

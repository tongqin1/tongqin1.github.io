 I am currently a researcher and developer at Lab 126, Amazon. Before joining Amazon, I spent several years in academia teaching mathematics and doing research on scientific computing and scientific machine learning. I got my PhD in Applied Mathematics from  
 [Division of Applied Mathematics](https://www.brown.edu/academics/applied-mathematics/), [Brown University](https://www.brown.edu/).  

In my spare time, I like reading and spending time with my family.

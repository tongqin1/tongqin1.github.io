I am currently a researcher and developer at Lab 126, Amazon. Before joining Amazon, I spent several years in academia [teaching](./teaching.md) mathematics and doing [research](./publications.md) on scientific computing and scientific machine learning. I got my PhD in Applied Mathematics from Brown University.

In my spare time, I like reading, travelling and spending time with my family.
